## Todo application (JS)

- allows to manage a list of tasks to do and performs adding, deleting, toogle comleted tasks and editing state of each task.
- built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
- demo is [here](https://precious-boba-8df571.netlify.app)

Note: This ToDo list is one of the earliest project in my front-end path and source code wasn't touch to track my progress since.
